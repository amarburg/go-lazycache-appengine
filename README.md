# go-lazycache-appengine

After some experimentation I determined this didn't need to be a standalone repo.  
The contents have been merged into [go-lazycache-app](https://github.com/amarburg/go-lazycache-app)
in the [deploy/g_appengine](https://github.com/amarburg/go-lazycache-app/tree/master/deploy/g_appengine/)
subdirectory.

<!-- This is the package for deploying [go-lazycache-app](https://github.com/amarburg/go-lazycache-app) through [Google App Engine.](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/)   We use the custom runtime functinoality where the deployment package is basically a Dockerfile plus the vendor-specific `app.yaml`  configuration file.

As it's all Docker-based, there actually no Go code in this repo.   -->
